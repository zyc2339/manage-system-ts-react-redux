/*
In TypeScript, declaration files (.d.ts files) are used to declare types and interfaces that can be globally accessible throughout your project without the need for explicit imports.
When you declare a type in a store.d.ts file, it becomes available globally within your TypeScript project. You can then use that type anywhere in your project without the need for an explicit import statement. TypeScript automatically understands and recognizes the types declared in .d.ts files.
